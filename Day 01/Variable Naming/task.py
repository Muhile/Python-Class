# Variables is a concept in programming that allows us to give a label to a piece of data so that we can refer or reference that data using the chosen variable name
# Here we will see  how to create variables and how to use the variables to access the contained value


# This line of code will take an input using the input() function and assign that to the variable name
# name = input("What is your name?")
# print(name)

# name = "Jack"
# print(name)

# name = "Angela"
# print(name)

# number = input("What is your input?")
# print(len(number))

# print(len(input("What is your input?")))

username = input("what is your username")
length = len(username)
print(length)
